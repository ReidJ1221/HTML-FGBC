        <h2>History</h3>
        <p>Since there are multiple wayts of practicing for sports, we would like to be that for eSports and namely fighting games.<br>
        For those that don't know, <span style="color:red; font-style:bold;">Fighting Games(FGs)</span> are a genre of player vs player(pvp) games where they control character and the player to finish a match with more HP than the opponent wins.<br>
        FGs were popular during the arcade era in the 80 and 90s and since fizzled out due to a "high barrier" of entry compared to other competitive genres and a lack of resources for players to grow.<br>

        The video above is the iconic Evo Moment 37 that happened in a semi finals match of Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike where Ken player Justin Wong makes an epic comeback from seemingly a hopeless match. We know there's talent in today's players and our goal is to make more moments like this.
